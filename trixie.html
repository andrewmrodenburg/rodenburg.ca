      <h1>Trixie appreciation page</h1>
      <p>
        Trixie was born and raised in Kitchener and then moved to Corinth in
        2018 at the age of about 3. She moved again in 2020 to Mississauga for a
        few months then again to Fenwick for 3 month stint. She had the best
        time of her life when she moved Toronto and got a two floor apartment
        with an access door so she could run around the floor whenever it was
        open. She then took the trip of a lifetime and hated every minute of the
        11 hour drive to Brooklyn from Toronto. But sheâ€™s been happy and healthy
        here to date where her main hobby is chewing on the couch.
